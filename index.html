            <p>Hey beautiful! Yeah you, whoever's reading this!</p>
            <p>Hi there, my name is Khang, born and raised in Viet Nam. I'm currently learning to become a full-stack web developer at UT-Houston Coding Bootcamp.
                Well, to be honest, I'm not one of those who will give the answer "I applied because coding is my passion" to employer. But the reason I decided to become
                a web developer is because I love the feeling when I built something and other people like it. Especialy when it's a website, which can be used by anyone, anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>So stop swiping left! Jump right to my portfolio site, and leave me a message right now to hire me.</p>
